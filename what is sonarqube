SONARQUBE --- STATIC CODE ANALYSIS


QUALITY CODE?
  the code having bug free?
  is it secure ?
  duplication avoided?
  tested properly?
  complex code?
  easy to integrate with other code?
  
All above review by your peer " peer review " 
May be we can ask our collugues who have best knowledge on programs and he will review and suggest for betterment of code
if you write long code to review its manually is difficult

================================= Code quality tools ===============================================

By using static code analysis you can improve code quality and reduces lots of time and efforts 
  
STATIC CODE ANALYSIS TOOLS:
--------------------------
SONARQUBE
COVERITY
RAXIS
VARACODE
CODESCENE

ADVANATAGE OF SONARQUBE? ( STATIC CODE ANALYSIS OR CODE QUALITY TOOL)
-----------------------

MAJOR IS?

Quality management tool.
Apart from code analysis it gather reports from various testing tools and display in nice GUI format.


================================ COMPONENTS of sonarqube =======================================

1.Sonarqube server

   Rules : 
       Instructions which you need to follow while wirting code. 
   Database : 
      Rules run on source code ,once analysis is done it store data in database.
   Web interface: 
      Once analysis stored in db , trhour ui we can analyse and understand easily
      
   Elastic search:
       helps to search required data from sonarqube db
       
   Sonarscanner:
       Service or agent which runs on system where code exists. 
       Java code , now you wnat report , you need to install sonarscanner on where source code exists and run scan
       
       wherever you have sonarscanner ---> you have source code exist
     
-------------------------------------------------------------
Support For 29 programming languages 

https://www.sonarqube.org/
For 29 programming languages

can generate code quality report on any of the generated programs

=================> How sonarqube communicate with sonar scanner <==========================================

             rules
Sonarqube ------------->Sonarscanner(Developer code)
          <------------
            report
SONARSCANNER:
-> Sonar scanner collects required information from source code.
-> your source code have sonarscanner.properties  file that  sonarscanner going to collect some info, if doesnot have sonarscanner.properties we should genrate.
-> Its going to gather applicable rules .( lets java program ) how its know sonar scanner if its a java project?
   It has that info, depending on that it pull the rules which are applicable for java. 
-> genrate reports
-> reports store in sonarqube server db
